            how it works.
            example:
                class test t << "abc" << "def" << "ghi";
            That statement will append the c strings to the character buffer
            contained within t.
            
            It works by starting right to left.
            phase 1.    the string "abc" will be appended to the buffer within t,
                        then a reference to t will be returned.
            
            phase 2.    the returned reference will be used to repeat step one,
                        but it will use "def", and append it to the buffer within t.
